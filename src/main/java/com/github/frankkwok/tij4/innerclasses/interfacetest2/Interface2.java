 * Exercise 9: Create an interface with at least one method, and implement that interface by defining an inner class
 * within a method, which returns a reference to your interface.
 * <p>
 * Page 273
 * Exercise 10: Repeat the previous exercise but define the inner class within a scope within a method.
 * Exercise 11: Create a private inner class that implements a public interface. Write a method that returns a reference
 * to an instance of the private inner class, upcast to the interface. Show that the inner class is completely hidden by
 * trying to downcast to it.

 * Page 276
 * Exercise 13: Repeat Exercise 9 using an anonymous inner class.
