 * Exercise 6: Change Music3.java so that what( ) becomes the root Object method toString( ). Try printing the
 * Instrument objects using System.out.println( ) (without any casting).
 * Exercise 7: Add a new type of Instrument to Music3.java and verify that polymorphism works for your new type.
 * Exercise 8: Modify Music3.java so that it randomly creates Instrument objects the way Shapes.java does.
